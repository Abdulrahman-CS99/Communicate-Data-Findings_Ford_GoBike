## Summary of Findings

> - I found that old ages users spend less time than younger ages users.
  - Subscriber users usually finish the trip faster than customer users.
  - The male gender is the most frequent gender to use our system.
  - San Francisco Caltrain station 2 and Market St at 10th St are the most used station for both the start and end of station trips.
